<h2>About Us</h2>
<p>
  The UNL Operating Systems &amp; Open-Source Group (OS2G) is a club for users of
  Linux and other Free and Open-Source Software (FOSS) to meet, socialize, and
  learn from one another. We also host events to introduce new members to the
  world of FOSS and enhance their computer literacy. We cover a wide range of
  topics including server administration, data science, cybersecurity, computer
  hardware, and programming languages.
